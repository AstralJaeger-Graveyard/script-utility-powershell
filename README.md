# UtilityPowershellScripts
This repository contains a couple of ps scripts I use on a regular basis.
## UpgradeAll
This script will run as administrator, upgrading all installed chocolately packages
## UpgradeAllAndRestart
This script is the same as the UpgradeAll script, but will restart the PC afterwards.
